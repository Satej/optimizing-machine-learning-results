## Course Description

<p>Deep learning as a technology has grown leaps and bounds in the last few years. More and more AI solutions use deep learning as their foundational technology. Studying this technology, however, presents several challenges. IT professionals from varying backgrounds need a simplified resource to learn the concepts and build models quickly. In this course, instructor Kumaran Ponnambalam provides a simplified path to understand various optimization and tuning options available for deep learning models and shows you how to use these options to improve models. He begins by reviewing Deep Learning, including artificial neural networks and architectures. Next, Kumaran discusses the process of hyper parameter tuning. He examines the building blocks of neural networks and the levers available to tune them. Kumaran offers recommendations and best practices. Then he concludes with an end-to-end tuning exercise.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out “Setting up exercise files" with this course to learn how to get started.</p>
